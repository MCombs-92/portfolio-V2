            <h6>
                Software Engineer, Army veteran, Cincinnati Native. I was born and raised in Cincinnati, attending 
                the same school district for the majority of my childhood and adolescent life. After graduation, I 
                embarked on a journey that lasted me 6 years, an active duty enlistment in the United States Army. I 
                served honorably as a satellite communications engineer, developing the initial roots of my technological
                background. After I completed my enlistment, I attended MAX technical training's full-stack development
                bootcamp in Mason, OH, where I learned the ins and outs of developing functional software in the .Net environment.
